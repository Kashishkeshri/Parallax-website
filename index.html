        <h2>our Relationship with Nature</h2>
        <p>Nature is part of our life. We grew out of the seed, the earth, and we are part of all that, but we are rapidly losing the sense that we are animals like the others. Can you have a feeling for a tree, look at it, see the beauty of it, listen to the sound it makes? Can you be sensitive to the little plant, a little weed, to that creeper growing up the wall, to the light on the leaves and the many shadows? One must be aware of all this and have that sense of communion with nature around you. You may live in a town, but you do have trees here and there. A flower in the next garden may be ill-kept, crowded with weeds, but look at it, feel that you are part of all that, part of all living things. If you hurt nature, you are hurting yourself.</p>

        <h2>WHAT WE HAVE</h2>
        <p>WHAT WE HAVE created between human beings is also a reality but a reality in which there are conflict and struggle. Everyone is trying to become something, both physically and inwardly. Spiritually, if I may use the word, we are all struggling to become something. When one is trying to become – ambition, competition, trying to achieve status politically or religiously – then you have no relationship with another, nor with nature. I doubt many of you who live in cities with all the crowds, noise and dirt, have come across nature often. You have this marvellous sea, but you have no relationship to it. You look at it; perhaps you swim there; but the feeling of the sea with its enormous vitality and energy, the beauty of a wave, its crashing upon the shore, there is no communication between that marvellous movement and yourself. If you have no relationship with that, how can you have relationship with another human being? If you don’t perceive the sea, the quality of the water, the waves, the enormous vitality of the tide going out and coming in, if you are not aware of that, how can one be aware or be sensitive to human relationship? Please, it is very important to understand this, because beauty, if one may talk about it, is not merely in the physical form, but beauty, in essence, is that quality of sensitivity, the quality of observation of nature.

        <p>Being outside in nature makes me feel happy when I’m sad. It gives my brain a chance to relax and reset.  Personally I tend to overthink situations and sometimes thinking about things so much makes me feel anxious and I’ve found that being outdoors helps me cope with some of these feelings.  The things you can learn and discover by being outside isn’t something that can be taught in a typical classroom.
